# ðŸŽ“About Me
I am a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore, working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/). I obtained my Ph.D from the Hefei University of Technology(HFUT), and was supervised by [Prof. Le Wu](https://le-wu.com) and [Prof. Richang Hong](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/hrc/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests include LLM safety(e.g., LLM alignment, LLM Interpretability, and reasoning safety) and data-centric recommendation(e.g., graph recommendation, LLM-based recommendation, and robust recommendation). I have published several papers in leading journals and conferences, such as IEEE TKDE, IEEE TBD, KDD, SIGIR, ACM Multimedia, and IJCAI. **If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at yyh.hfut@gmail.com or yh_yang@nus.edu.sg.**
